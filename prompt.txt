Create an R script which uses ggplot2::ggplot() to create a stacked bar plot of 
Global Deaths from Particulate Matter Air Pollution (2023) by Causes of Death 
and Risk Factor, for Deaths (%) >= 0.1. Please note that the Value variable for 
these percentages is not actually in percentage units, so you will need to 
multiply them by 100 before applying the >= 0.1 condition. Use the CSV file in 
the data folder for the data to be plotted. Use readr::read_csv() to read the 
file and use janitor::clean_names() to normalize the variable names. Use 
pacman::p_load() for loading any additional R packages. Only use values where 
the Measure is "Percent of total deaths". Create a folder called "figures" for 
storing the plot as a PNG file. Divide the work into several steps and add error 
handling for each step.

The stacked bar plot should have horizontal bars, meaning the x-axis will be 
Deaths (%) and the y-axis will be Cause of Death. Make sure the x-axis labels 
are sequential integers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, ..., 6. Make sure you sort the stacked 
bars top to bottom from longest to shortest, as this is common practice. The 
stacked bars should be filled according to the Risk Factor variable using pastel 
colors. Annotate each bar segment with the Deaths (%) value they represent, 
rounded to 1 decimal place. For the annotations, use the same font (size, color, 
darkness, etc.) as the Causes of Death and place the annotations just inside the 
right end of each bar segment. Add a plot caption to the lower right margin which 
states the data source.
