# air_pollution_deaths

This repository hosts a "vibe coding" example consisting of an R script "air_pollution_plot.R" written mostly by generative AI (qwen3-coder:30b), with only a few minor manual edits, plus some supporting files. The data used for the plot was downloaded from IHME GBD Compare and stored as a CSV in the data folder. The LLM prompt used in the VS Code extension Cline was saved in "prompt.txt". The output plot was saved in the figures folder as "air_pollution_deaths.png".

An alternative solution was generated by Claude Sonnet 4.5 and saved as "Claude Sonnet Solution.R" with image output saved in the figures folder as "air_pollution_deaths_stacked_bar.png".

Another alternative solution was generated by Gemini Flash 2.5 and saved as "Gemini Solution.R" with image output saved in the figures folder as "global_air_pollution_deaths_stacked_bar.png".

Lastly, an alternative solution generated by Gemini 3 Pro Thinking, using a simplified prompt, and saved as "Gemini 3 Pro Thinking Solution.R" with image output saved in the figures folder as "global_deaths_particulate_matter_2023.png".

Interestingly,  Gemini 3 Pro Thinking generated a Python script before producing the R script. This Python script was saved as "Gemini 3 Pro Thinking Solution.py" and the resulting plot file saved as "figures/global_deaths_particulate_matter_2023_python.png".
