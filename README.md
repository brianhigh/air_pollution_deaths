# air_pollution_deaths

This repository hosts a "vibe coding" example consisting of an R script written mostly by generative AI, with only a few minor manual edits, plus some supporting files. The data used for the plot was downlaoded from IHME GBD Compare and stored as a CSV in the data folder. The LLM prompt used in the VS Code extension Cline was saved in prompt.txt. The output plot was saved in the figures folder.
