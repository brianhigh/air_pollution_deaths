# air_pollution_deaths

This repository hosts a "vibe coding" example consisting of an R script "air_pollution_plot.R" written mostly by generative AI (qwen3-coder:30b), with only a few minor manual edits, plus some supporting files. The data used for the plot was downloaded from IHME GBD Compare and stored as a CSV in the data folder. The LLM prompt used in the VS Code extension Cline was saved in "prompt.txt". The output plot was saved in the figures folder as "air_pollution_deaths.png".
